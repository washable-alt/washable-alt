## Graphical User Interfaces with Tkinter and Function Arguments


# *Args and **Kwargs - Non keyword Arguments (Limited to 3 arguments in the form of a tuple) vs Keyword Arguments; args and kwargs are just names you can give to them


# Many Keyworded Arguments - Created unlimited optional keyword arguments - it is a dictionary and to output the value, it can be expressed as kwargs[key] to get the value; use kwargs for named arguments in a function

# argv is an argument vector - an array of pointers to arrays of character objects



# Tkinter - Learn how to create labels, how to create buttons

# In order to start - Create a new window and configurations by using Tk()
# tk.Label()

# GUI Tools - Starting from a label, button, entries(textbox), text, spinbox ( a widget that allows you to select a value from a set of values), check button, radio button and listbox


# Convert Mile to Km converter
# Create the miles label
# Create the kilometers label
# use .config command to change text
# create the convert button

# Created a second mile to km converter with a click event that removes the entry text when clicked and justify the user input to center
