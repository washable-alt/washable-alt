Series - 1 dimensional labelled array

Dataframe - 2 dimensional, size-mutable (elements can be appended or deleted/pop-ed from a DataFrame)

# TODO 1: Read the CSV datafile and use pandas DataFrame
# Convert into a dictionary
# Convert into a list
# Print mean temperature
# Print maximum temperature

# Create a dataframe

# TODO 2: For the squirrel_count dataset
# Filter based on 3 colours - Gray, Cinnamon, Black

# First step - Read the csv file using pd.read_csv() and name it as data
# Second step - Get the count of the columns using the len function and filtering the data where colors match grey, cinnamon or black - i.e. len(data[data[PRIMARY FUR COLOR]=='Grey/Cinnamon/Black'])
# Third step - Create a dictionary with key as the column names, and values as the column values and name it as data_dict
# Fourth step - Create pandas Dataframe Convert to csv file 
# Convert to CSV - df.to_csv("squirrel_count.csv")

# TODO 3: Create the us-states-game-start

# Turtle can add object called screen.addshape(image)
# Using a csv file that contains the x and y coordinates of U.S. states, the x and y coordinates can be pinpointed on the image
#  screen.textinput(title="",prompt="").title() can help to generate a text input box for the user to input their guess and it will convert to first letter of the word as capital letter
# i.e. ohio becomes Ohio 
# use of list comprehension
# convert list to dict
# create the dataframe
# transpose dataframe
# output to csv
